  blogText:"Yatri’s focus from day one has been to develop systems and technologies in-house from the ground up. This approach gives the team the freedom to take on broad mobility challenges that will bring real impact. We envision that in the coming decade we will produce the most affordable two wheeler accessible to more and more people. However, in the phase 2, we will shift our focus to the root of the urban mobility problem. We believe public transportation should be a matter of civic pride for the inhabitants of the city, and to some extent, public transportation is a reflection of the city and its inhabitants. Our goal is to uplift and bring public transportation to a new level with reliability, safety and finest user experience.We believe this will create an ecosystem of products and services that will enable seamless transition into electric mobility!"
